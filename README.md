# Windows 7 Cursor Pack (Default)

## Do you really like the windows 7 defalt cursor pack?

**I do.** And, for others that also like the windows 7 cursor theme, ALL you have to do is download these. Then you must click "browse" on the window where you edit your cursor. 

This is mainly because of my personal use, but I thought I might as well make it public.
Your welcome. 
**THERE ARE ONLY DEFAULT CURSORS IN THIS GITHUB REPOSITORY. PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND.**
_lol_
